This is my first time submiting a project to Microverse. There wasn't any complicated code nevertheless I enjoyed working at this simple project. I created a .gitignore file. I set up a linter for HTML & CSS. I added 3 files an HTML, CSS & a test.md. The test.md file is the only file that's added to the .gitignore file.
